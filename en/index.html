<p>
    Launch the application (click on the “FA mob” icon), the application start page will appear. Then click on the “Start” button, a page appears on which the process of the victim’s heart is displayed.In the event that the heart is working, an electrocardiogram (ECG) will move on the smartphone screen and the inscription: “HAS PULSE” will appear. If the heart stopped, then instead of the ECG there is a straight line and the inscription appears: "PULSE NO", in this case, you need to immediately begin to give the victim a heart massage and artificial respiration. The effectiveness of these actions needs to be constantly monitored on the smartphone screen.
</p>

<h3>Cardiac rhythm control</h3>

<p>
    Launch the application (click on the “ecg mob” icon), the setup pages will appear (setup is done once). Here you enter: last name, first name, gender, date of birth, set the recording duration to 30, 60 or 180 seconds and record the address to which you can send the ECG for decryption. To register the ECG, press the round button with the image of the ECG. After recording, a page with an ECG in PDF format will appear. If you want to send your ECG to the specified address, click the "Send" button. A mail application page appears with an attached ECG. Here, also click the "Send" button.
