    FIRST AID
</h3>

<p>
    <b>First aid - assistance to victims provided by people around before the arrival of medical workers</b>.
    First Aid actions are extremely important, as the time factor is of great importance, and the quick adoption of necessary measures by people around us can save many lives. The ability to provide first aid is considered necessary for a modern person. In many countries, this is taught in schools, colleges, universities. Moreover, persons whose profession is associated with an increased risk should possess these skills: military personnel, police, firefighters, rescuers, climbers, drivers, bodyguards, etc. There are a large number of companies that provide such training. Every year, tens of millions of people undergo First Aid training around the world. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies coordinate this work. She also issues textbooks and instructions on how to conduct First Aid.

<p>
    An important element of First Aid is cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), with its providence, it is first necessary to determine the presence or absence of the victim's pulse. If there is no pulse, immediate cardiac massage is needed, if there is a pulse, massage is not only not necessary, but also dangerous. In accordance with the instructions, the pulse is determined by palpation of the carotid artery. However, practice and special studies have shown that in most cases, especially in extreme conditions, it is not possible to control the pulse of the injured person using this method. This fact significantly reduces the number of people saved during First Aid.

<p>
    Personal ECG monitor <b>"KardioMob"</b> and smartphone with <b>FA mob</b> application solve the problem of reliably determining the presence or absence of cardiac activity in heart attacks, accidents, injuries, terrorist acts or on the battlefield. When applying the devices do not need to grope the victim's carotid pulse and that it is very important that you do not need to interrupt the heart massage and artificial respiration for the periodic control! Reliable information on pulse helps decide the feasibility of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. When using ECG monitor the actions of others in carrying out resuscitation until the arrival of medical professionals become more efficient.

<p>
    Application <b>FA mob</b> is intended for use in conjunction with personal ECG monitor <b>"KardioMob"</b> or with similar parameters. Cardiac activity of the victim is evaluated by electrocardiogram (ECG), which is deducted from the electrodes glued to the patient's wrists; it allows not undressing a person, which is very important in an extreme situation. ECG with wrists corresponds to the first standard lead hand in hand. ECG monitor enhances the biopotencialy heart, encodes them and cable passes into the headphone socket your Smartphone or tablet, if such is not available, the connector with the cable signal adapter into the socket to charge your Smartphone. Surrounding people who provide first aid to the injured, receive the necessary information on Smartphone displays, a special algorithm determines the presence or absence of a pulse.
