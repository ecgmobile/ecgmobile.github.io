    <h3> First aid </h3>

    <p>
        In the application FA mob, decoding of the ECG (for the presence or absence of a rhythmic component) is carried out in real time automatically. Remote decoding of the ECG in this case is not possible, due to the need for an urgent decision on the feasibility of cardiac massage and artificial respiration. If the condition of the victim is stabilized, then you can temporarily switch to the ecg mob application, register the ECG and subsequently show it to the doctor.

    <h3> Cardiac rhythm control </h3>

    <p>
        In the ecg mob application in the settings, you can record the doctor's address: cardiogram@bioss.ru After removing the ECG, the application will automatically offer to send the ECG to this address. In a response letter, the doctor will send an assessment of your ECG for free!
